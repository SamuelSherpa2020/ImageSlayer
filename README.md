# ImageSlayer - (IS) ⚔️ 

- IS is the C# console application which helps to convert base64 saved text data from Database(DB) back to it's original form and save the file in a given location.
- The application would help to reduce the storage from Database.
- All you need is the servername, and database name.

- Thank You 😊
